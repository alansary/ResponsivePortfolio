mobile-first approach
responsive web design
	use % (relative-unit) rather than px (fixed-unit)
	use max-width rather than width
	use min-width rather than width
	use max-height rather than height
	use min-height rather than height
	use the css rule called media query
inside each css media query rule we will add additional css rules that will be applied if the conditions are true
	add viewport meta tag that allow us to control the size of the browser window on mobile devices so that instead of site visitors zooming
		around the page, our layout will be look for the size of the window
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
		before this line the desktop layout will render on mobile devices instead of mobile devices render
		that means the viewport (which is the name) should be set to the value for the content (which is the width of our website should be scaled
			so that its equal to the width of the mobile device screen and the initial-scale should be set to 1.0 because setting it to another
			value will make it larger or smaller than we want)
